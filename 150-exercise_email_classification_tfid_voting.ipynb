Often, different topics are handled by different people or departments. Wouldn’t it be great to have an automatic e-mail classifier that forwards e-mails to the right person? Let’s try to make this.  \n","  \n","We start from a set of 9.820 real e-mails originating from several e-mail services like monster.com, nieuwsblad.be, datanews.be, etc.. The e-mails belong to four categories: _advertisements_ , _job offerings_ , _news_ and _ICT_ . We’d like to create a classifier that can be used to automatically classify e-mails into one of the four categories ADS, JOB, NEWS and ICT. \n","We start by importing and exploring the data. \n","\n","In a previous exercise we used word embeddings and a neural network for document classification, but do we really need these advanced and compute-intensive techniques?\n","\n","Create a model based on based on TFidVectorizer iso word embeddings and use a voting classifier.   \n","\n","Compare the accuracy of this model to the accuracy of the neural network you created above. \n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":7405,"status":"ok","timestamp":1652414651267,"user":{"displayName":"Sabine De Vreese","userId":"01431929970271618335"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"hik9nDQtAFrc","outputId":"f7341a8f-a3f4-474f-faea-35d785923299"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["2.8.0\n"]}],"source":["# Importing the necessary packages\n","import numpy as np                                  # \"Scientific computing\"\n","import scipy.stats as stats                         # Statistical tests\n","\n","import pandas as pd                                 # Data Frame\n","from pandas.api.types import CategoricalDtype\n","\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt                     # Basic visualisation\n","\n","import seaborn as sns                               # Advanced data visualisation\n","\n","from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\n","from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer\n","from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\n","\n","# Helper libraries\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import sklearn as sk\n","import pandas as pd\n","\n","# fix random seed for reproducibility\n","seed = 2020\n","np.random.seed(seed)  \n","\n","import sklearn as sk\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","\n","\n","import nltk\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":20819,"status":"ok","timestamp":1652414672074,"user":{"displayName":"Sabine De Vreese","userId":"01431929970271618335"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"SAUWwKSaAI0q","outputId":"14236d85-103a-4cc6-8e31-64be571d5442"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["You are not running on Google Colab\n"]}],"source":["if 'google.colab' in str(get_ipython()):\n","    colab = True\n","    print ('You are running on Google Colab')\n","else:\n","    colab = False\n","    print ('You are not running on Google Colab')\n","\n","if colab:\n","    from google.colab import drive\n","    drive.mount('/content/gdrive')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"hNaYwydBo-n3"},"source":["Read the files"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":5958,"status":"ok","timestamp":1652414678026,"user":{"displayName":"Sabine De Vreese","userId":"01431929970271618335"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"xTO2vRFi900I"},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","\n","if colab:\n","    ads = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdecorte/machinelearning/main/datasets/emailADS.csv',encoding = \"ISO-8859-1\")\n","    ict = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdecorte/machinelearning/main/datasets/emailICT.csv',encoding = \"ISO-8859-1\")\n","    job = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdecorte/machinelearning/main/datasets/emailJOB.csv',encoding = \"ISO-8859-1\")\n","    news = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdecorte/machinelearning/main/datasets/emailNEWS.csv',encoding = \"ISO-8859-1\")\n","else:\n","    ads = pd.read_csv('datasets/emailADS.csv',encoding = \"ISO-8859-1\")\n","    ict = pd.read_csv('datasets/emailICT.csv',encoding = \"ISO-8859-1\")\n","    job = pd.read_csv('datasets/emailJOB.csv',encoding = \"ISO-8859-1\")\n","    news = pd.read_csv('datasets/emailNEWS.csv',encoding = \"ISO-8859-1\")\n","\n"]}],"metadata":{"celltoolbar":"Slideshow","colab":{"collapsed_sections":[],"name":"email_classification Solution.ipynb","provenance":[]},"interpreter":{"hash":"11938c6bc6919ae2720b4d5011047913343b08a43b18698fd82dedb0d4417594"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3.9.12 64-bit","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.12"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
