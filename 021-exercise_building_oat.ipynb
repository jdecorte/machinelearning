The **power** (Dutch: Vermogen), expressed in Watt (W),  of a building is a measure for the instantaneous energy comsumption.  Compare it to a light bulb of 10 W: if it is used for one hour it consumes 10 Wh (or 0.01 kWh) of electricity. On your electrity bill you are charged per kWh. Similarly, the power of a building in this exercise determines the energy consumption for heating.  A power of 160 kW (at a given outside temperature and a required inside temperature, which may vary during the day and week) means the building \"looses\" 160 kWh of heat energy per hour, which has to be provided by the heating installation to ensure a constant inside temperature."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Setup Python and the most common libraries"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":1048,"status":"ok","timestamp":1605129076077,"user":{"displayName":"Johan Decorte","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgDUX4gVbZFE5ZrvlBBat5BOT71bs3jNvj2eIHRHQ=s64","userId":"18167446940437337218"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"9JNaat3aJb7f"},"outputs":[],"source":["import sys\n","import sklearn\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","import os\n","%matplotlib inline\n","import matplotlib as mpl\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Import buildingoat.csv from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdecorte/machinelearning/main/datasets/buildingoat.csv.
