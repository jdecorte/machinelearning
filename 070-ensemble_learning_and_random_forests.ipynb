    "- Boosting refers to any Ensemble method that can combine several weak learners into a strong learner. \n",
    "- The general idea of most boosting methods is to train predictors sequentially, each trying to correct its predecessor. \n",
    "- There are many boosting methods available, but by far the most popular are _AdaBoost_ (short for _Adaptive Boosting_) and _Gradient Boosting_. \n",
    "- Let’s start with AdaBoost.\n",
    "## AdaBoost\n",
    "- One way for a new predictor to correct its predecessor is to pay a bit more attention to the training instances that the predecessor underfitted. \n",
    "- This results in new predictors focusing more and more on the hard cases.\n",
    "- The algorithm first trains a base classifier (such as a Decision Tree) and uses it to make predictions on the training set.\n",
    "- The algorithm then increases the relative weight of misclassified training instances. \n",
    "- Then it trains a second classifier, using the updated weights, and again makes predictions on the training set, updates the instance weights, and so on;"
